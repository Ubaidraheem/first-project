<h1>Ubaid's Best Movies</h1>
<h2>My personal favourite</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Godzilla</h3>
<p>2014 godzilla was indeed a new taste<br/>
As a child this was my first interactions with Titans<br/>
and i loved it</p>
<h3>Godzilla kotm</h3>
<p>After in the first movie godzilla defeated two kajus alone.<br/>
In this movie godzilla will be against a titan twice his size, strength and power<br/>
But he still managed to defeat it</p>
<h3>Godzilla vs Kong</h3>
<p>In this movie Godzilla fights with kong nearly kills him but in the end <br/>
    He fights with a robot version of himself with help of kong
</p>

<h2>My Most Awaited Movie</h2>
<h3>Godzilla x kong NEW EMPIRE</h3>
<p>So far the trailer have sumed up that it will be a titan movie like never before<br/>
Packed with a lot of eye catching vfx and action<br/>
Overall i am very Anticipated for it </p>
